# EduGenius — Go-Live Checklist

*The single document Giri needs to flip from "demo" to "live". All pre-work is done. These are the ~30 minutes of configuration needed.*

---

## Status Legend
- ✅ Done (code already implements this)
- ⏳ Needs your input (requires credentials / decisions)
- 🔧 Optional (can add post-launch)

---

## Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key (5 min)

**This is the ONLY required step to make AI work.**

1. Go to → https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`)

Cost: Free tier gives 60 requests/minute, 1M tokens/day. More than enough to start.

---

## Step 2: Deploy to Netlify (10 min)

The frontend is already configured with `netlify.toml` — just connect and deploy.

### Option A: Git Auto-Deploy (recommended)

1. Go to → https://app.netlify.com
2. Click **Add new site → Import an existing project**
3. Connect GitHub → Select `mathconcepts/edugenius-v2`
4. Set **Base directory**: `frontend`
5. Build command: `npm run build` (auto-filled from netlify.toml)
6. Publish directory: `dist` (auto-filled)
7. Click **Deploy**

### Option B: Manual Deploy (if GitHub not connected)

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
# Then drag the `dist/` folder to netlify.com/drop
```

---

## Step 3: Add Environment Variables in Netlify (5 min)

**Netlify Dashboard → Your Site → Site Configuration → Environment Variables**

### Minimum Required

| Variable | Value | Where to get |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | `AIza...` | https://aistudio.google.com |

### Recommended for Production

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `VITE_APP_NAME` | `EduGenius` | Shows in browser tab |
| `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID` | `G-XXXXXXXXXX` | Google Analytics (optional) |

### Payments (when ready)

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | `rzp_live_...` | Indian payments |
| `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `pk_live_...` | International payments |

After adding env vars → **Trigger a new deploy** (Deploys tab → Trigger deploy).

---

## Step 4: Custom Domain (5 min, optional)

1. Netlify → Your Site → Domain Management → Add Custom Domain
2. Add: `app.edugenius.in` (or your chosen domain)
3. Update your DNS: Add CNAME pointing to `your-site.netlify.app`
4. SSL is auto-provisioned (free, via Let's Encrypt)

---

## Step 5: Verify Everything Works (5 min)

Visit your deployed URL and check:

- [ ] Homepage loads (marketing site at `/website`)
- [ ] Login/register flow works
- [ ] Chat with AI tutor works (says "Powered by Gemini" in header)
- [ ] Student dashboard shows correctly after login with student role
- [ ] Exam Insights page loads (`/insights`)
- [ ] Math renders correctly (test with: `What is $x^2 + 2x + 1$?`)
