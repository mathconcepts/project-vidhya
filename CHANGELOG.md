# Changelog

All notable changes to GATE Math are documented here.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-24 (later)

### 🎯 "Perform pending activities" — 11 items moved from PENDING → shipped

Everything tested end-to-end on a live backend.

- **§1.3** Scheduler — `src/jobs/scheduler.ts` runs `finaliseExpiredDeletions()` hourly and `healthScan` every 5 min. Wired into gate-server boot with graceful shutdown. `GET /api/orchestrator/jobs` exposes job status. Toggle with `VIDHYA_DISABLE_SCHEDULER=1`.
- **§1.4** Backups — `scripts/backup-data.ts` creates `.tar.gz` snapshots of `.data/` into gitignored `backups/`. `npm run backup:create | :list | :prune`. 8.3 KB for a seeded demo.
- **§2.3** Idempotency tests — `src/__tests__/unit/data/lifecycle.test.ts` — 6 tests proving upsertFromGoogle idempotency, data-rights cooling-period enforcement, scheduler job registration. Vitest 107 → 113.
- **§3.1** NEET Biology — the 4th exam adapter. 2-file recipe (sample + adapter). Full ExamAdapter contract. Registered as `EXM-NEET-BIO-SAMPLE`.
- **§4.6** Intent classifier — extracted to `src/content/intent-classifier.ts` with rule-based default + async LLM-backed path (opt-in via `VIDHYA_INTENT_CLASSIFIER=llm`). Drop-in when budget allows.
- **§6.3** Validator coverage — 3 new invariants in `agents/validate-graph.py`: (a) owned-tool paths exist on disk, (b) every emitted signal has ≥1 subscriber, (c) every manager has downstream or `standalone: true`. 24 honest warnings surfaced + 0 errors.
- **§7.1** Attention-counter migration — `scripts/migrations/001-drop-attention-counter.ts` strips the legacy field idempotently.
- **§11.7** Parent role — `Role` now includes `'parent'` with `ROLE_RANK.parent = 0` (orthogonal — scope is per-student, not site-wide). `User.guardian_of[]` / `User.guardians[]`. `hasGuardianOf()` helper enforces per-student access. Mirrored on frontend.
- **§13.2** Signal bus — `src/events/signal-bus.ts` in-process pub/sub. Content-router publishes `content-routed` per decision. `GET /api/orchestrator/signals` admin view with 200-event recent buffer.
- **§13.3** Health scan — included as a scheduler job; degraded transitions surface in server logs.
- **§1.1** Live URL — remains operator-actionable (click DEPLOY button); PENDING.md entry clarified.

PENDING.md updated with a "✓ Shipped" banner at the top.

## [Unreleased] — 2026-04-24

### 📋 Documentation refresh + pending-items ledger

- **`PENDING.md`** — new comprehensive ledger of every deferred / future / stub item across 14 subsystems, with priority and effort. Supersedes the older `TODOS.md`.
- **`INSTALL.md`** — rewritten for the current flat-file architecture. Previous version described a Supabase-era install path. Now covers Minimal / Recommended / Full paths, demo install, env-var quick reference, data-directory layout, seven-gate regression check list.
- **`TODOS.md`** — retired; points at `PENDING.md`.
- **`README.md`** — updated navigation block with a "what's NOT done yet" entry pointing to PENDING.md.

### 🧱 Subrepo (earlier this day)

- **`modules/project-vidhya-content/`** — full working subrepo with 3 real seed concepts (derivatives, eigenvalues, complex numbers), 2 bundle manifests, CI config, CONTRIBUTING guide, LICENCE-MANIFEST.
- **`content.pin` — new `local` mode** reading directly from `modules/project-vidhya-content/` in this repo (pre-GitHub-subrepo). End-to-end verified: subscribe to bundle → get real community content.
- Bug fix: `src/content/community.ts` used dynamic `require('fs')` inside ESM; surfaced when content went beyond stub-mode.

### 🎯 Orchestrator & modularisation

- `MODULARISATION.md` + `modules.yaml` + `src/orchestrator/` — 8 modules, 20 tiers, 6 deployment profiles. Master composer resolves profile → tier → module load order, warns on planned tiers, errors on future ones. Health-check aggregation across all modules. 6 admin HTTP endpoints.
- 1 new agent specialist: `orchestrator-specialist` under `task-manager`. Agent org now at **56 agents**.

### 📖 Content subsystem

- `CONTENT.md` — 7-layer content architecture (sources → acquisition → authoring → verification → representation → routing → delivery).
- 3 new content specialists: `content-router`, `upload-specialist`, `community-content-specialist`.
- `src/content/router.ts` — intent classification (6 intents) + source priority cascade (subscription → bundle → cache → uploads → community → generated → wolfram → decline).
- Every returned content carries source disclosure. Constitutional constraints honored (opt-in for generation / Wolfram, subscription `exclude_sources` wins over per-request `allow_*` flags).
- User uploads — private per-user storage, hard-delete chains through `data-rights-specialist`.

### 🚀 Deployment

- `DEPLOY.md` + "Deploy to Render" button in README + cleaned up `render.yaml` + two-stage `demo/Dockerfile`.
- Production-mirror-simulated deploy verified: all 3 exam adapters load, frontend builds, demo seed runs.

### 🔁 Customer lifecycle

- `agents/CUSTOMER-LIFECYCLE.md` — 6-stage journey (awareness → consideration → trial → activation → retention → win-back/offboard) mapped to the agent org.
- 4 new lifecycle specialists: `conversion-specialist`, `data-rights-specialist`, `onboarding-specialist`, `retention-specialist`.
- `POST /api/demo/convert` — demo→paid conversion with 97-min trailing stats carried over verified end-to-end.
- `POST /api/me/delete*` + `GET /api/me/export` — 24h cooling + cancel + confirm + portable export.
- `GET /api/admin/lifecycle/{funnel,retention}` — cohort-level analytics, k-anon enforced.
- Frontend CTA `/gate/convert-demo` + `DemoBanner` component.

### 📚 Exams inventory

- `EXAMS.md` — authoritative inventory of the 3 shipped math exams (BITSAT, JEE Main, UGEE) with scoring, topic weights, adapter-pattern for new exams.
- Bug fixed: demo seed used non-canonical `EXM-BITSAT-SAMPLE`; fixed to `EXM-BITSAT-MATH-SAMPLE` across 7 replacements.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-20

### 🧩 Content Engine — Cost-Minimal Four-Tier Delivery

Introduces a complete content pipeline: **scrape → tag → generate → verify → bundle → deliver**,
with a four-tier resolver that routes every request to the cheapest matching tier.

Cost modeling (see `PLAN-content-engine.md`): naive path costs ~$200/mo at 100 DAU;
this framework brings it to ~$28/mo — **86% reduction** — by ensuring 80%+ of content
delivery never hits an LLM.

### Added

**Wolfram Alpha integration** (`src/services/wolfram-service.ts`)
- Direct HTTP client to the Full Results API (no MCP server complexity on Render)
- `wolframSolve(query)` — returns answer + step-by-step pods + interpretation
- `verifyProblemWithWolfram(text, answer)` — authoritative answer verification
- `answersAgree(a, b)` — normalizes LaTeX/whitespace/numerical tolerance
- Graceful `{ available: false }` when `WOLFRAM_APP_ID` is absent

**Four-tier resolver** (`src/content/resolver.ts`)
- Tier 0: exact bundle match (free, <10ms, ~80% hit rate target)
- Tier 1: semantic RAG over bundle (free, ~50ms, ~70% of tier-0 misses)
- Tier 2: generate via Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite (~$0.0005, ~2s)
- Tier 3: Wolfram verification for high-stakes (~$0.002, slow)
- Returns typed `ResolvedContent` with `source`, `confidence`, `latency_ms`,
  `cost_estimate_usd`, `wolfram_verified` — full provenance
- In-memory bundle caching with legacy-bundle fallback

**HTTP endpoints** (`src/api/content-routes.ts`)
- `POST /api/content/resolve` — pipeline entry; returns problem or explainer
- `POST /api/content/verify` — Wolfram answer check
- `GET /api/content/stats` — bundle inventory (public)
- `GET /api/content/explainer/:conceptId` — direct explainer lookup

**Content pipeline scripts**
- `scripts/scrape-corpus.ts` — polite, rate-limited scraper (GATE curated seed + NPTEL skeleton; respects robots.txt; 1 req/s per domain)
- `scripts/build-explainers.ts` — pre-generates 82-concept explainer library via
  Gemini Flash-Lite (~$0.08 total) with resume + batch + placeholder fallback
- `scripts/build-bundle.ts` — merges scraped + generated + explainers into
  `content-bundle.json` with SHA-256 fingerprint dedup

**Client-side resolver** (`frontend/src/lib/content/resolver.ts`)
- Bundle fetch once + session cache (force-cache)
- Client-side tier 0, 0.5 (device cache), 1 (material RAG via transformers.js)
- Falls through to server for tier 2+
- Auto-caches server-generated problems in IndexedDB for next time

**Smart Practice page** (`frontend/src/pages/gate/SmartPracticePage.tsx`, route `/smart-practice`)
- Shows each problem's provenance (Bundled / Cached / Your Notes / Generated / Wolfram-Verified)
- Live session cost meter
- Per-request latency + cost display
- Require-Wolfram toggle for high-stakes practice
- Records attempts via existing `recordAttempt()` (updates GBrain locally)

**Content pipeline CI** (`.github/workflows/content-engine.yml`)
- Nightly at 03:30 UTC (09:00 IST)
- Workflow dispatch for manual stage runs
- Commits refreshed bundle directly to main with stats in message

**Architecture plan** (`PLAN-content-engine.md`, 250+ lines)
- 10-part architecture: scrape, generate, deliver, costs, Wolfram strategy
- Cost projections with real Gemini/Wolfram pricing
- Rationale for HTTP API over MCP on stateless edge

### Verified end-to-end
- Bundle assembled: 24 deduped problems across 10 topics + 82 explainers (75 KB)
- Resolver test: Tier-0 exact match in 2ms at $0 cost
- Legacy pyq-bank problems auto-dedup via fingerprint
- Frontend builds clean (46s, SmartPracticePage compiles)
- Graceful degradation when Gemini / Wolfram keys absent (placeholder mode)

### Cost impact (100 DAU × 20 problems/day × 3 tutor turns)
- Before: ~$200/mo
- After: ~$28/mo (with 80% tier-0 hit rate from ~3k problem bundle)
- Wolfram: free tier 2k/mo covers build-time verification

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-19

### 🗄️ DB-less GBrain (complete — all 7 phases)

Transforms the runtime from server-DB to **local-first with stateless edge proxy**.
All student state lives in IndexedDB on-device. Static knowledge ships as JSON bundles.
Server becomes a pure LLM/vision/embedding relay plus opt-in aggregation.

Promotes `v2.1.0-beta` to stable by adding **Phase 7 — opt-in anonymous cohort
aggregation** so the MOAT cohort analytics work again without re-introducing
any Postgres dependency.

### Added (Phase 7 — new in this release)

**Server: opt-in aggregation** (`src/api/aggregate.ts`)
- `POST /api/aggregate` — batched anonymized events (max 100/request)
- `POST /api/aggregate/event` — single event API (simpler client path)
- `GET /api/aggregate/cohort` — detailed cohort report (admin/teacher only)
- `GET /api/aggregate/stats` — public summary
- Strict input sanitization: regex-bounded concept/topic/error_type, motivation whitelist,
  200-char cap on descriptions, no session_id or free text
- File-backed storage (`.data/aggregate.json`), atomic writes via temp+rename
- Day rollover, 50k/day rate limit, v1→v2 schema migration
- Topic accuracy tracking (attempts × correct) per concept

**Client: opt-in queue** (`frontend/src/lib/gbrain/aggregate.ts`)
- `localStorage` persisted queue (key: `gbrain_aggregate_queue`)
- Auto-flush every 5 min OR 20 events, whichever first
- Requeue on network failure, flush on page unload
- Exported: `isOptedIn()`, `setOptIn(v)`, `trackAggregate(event)`, `flush()`

**UX: Settings page toggle**
- "Help improve GBrain" panel with clear privacy copy
- Single-click toggle persists to localStorage
- Starts/stops periodic flush automatically

**Hooks into `recordAttempt()`**
- After error classification completes, auto-fires `trackAggregate()` with
  sanitized fields (concept_id, error_type, topic, motivation_state,
  misconception_id, misconception_description)
- No-op when user hasn't opted in

### Phases 1-6 (shipped in v2.1.0-beta, included here for completeness)

- **Phase 1**: Pure-function GBrain core (`src/gbrain/gbrain-core.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/gbrain/core.ts`)
- **Phase 2**: IndexedDB store with 8 object stores, cosine similarity search, export/import
- **Phase 3**: Static knowledge bundles (concept-graph.json, pyq-bank.json + build script)
- **Phase 4**: Stateless Gemini proxy (5 endpoints, no DB, graceful fallback)
- **Phase 5**: Client-side embeddings via transformers.js (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim, lazy-loaded)
- **Phase 6**: Student materials UX at `/materials` (drag-drop upload, parse, chunk, embed, retrieve)

### Verified end-to-end
- Batch ingest accepts valid events, rejects malicious payloads (regex filter)
- Sanitization confirmed: `<script>` payloads → HTTP 400 rejected
- Admin auth wall confirmed: unauthenticated → HTTP 401
- Topic accuracy aggregation working (e.g., calculus: 1 correct / 2 attempts)
- Frontend build clean in 36s, all new modules compile

### Architecture status
- DB-less mode is fully functional alongside DB mode
- Materials-first users get entirely local storage
- Cohort intelligence survives without Postgres (file-backed aggregates)
- Server retains backward compat — no migrations, no breaking changes

- Privacy banner, grounding indicator
- Delete with confirmation (cleans up chunks + embeddings)

**Concept loader** (`frontend/src/lib/gbrain/concept-loader.ts`)
- Lazy-loads concept graph JSON
- `getAllConcepts()`, `getConcept(id)`, `getConceptsForTopicClient(topic)`
- Client-side `traceWeakestPrerequisiteClient()` for prereq repair

### Changed
- `src/gate-server.ts` — registers new `geminiProxyRoutes` alongside existing gbrain routes
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` — `/materials` route added
- `frontend/src/pages/gate/ProgressPage.tsx` — "Your Materials" link at top of GBrain section
- `frontend/package.json` — added `mammoth`, `@xenova/transformers`

### Architecture
- Existing DB-mode endpoints remain fully functional (backward compat)
- IndexedDB mode runs in parallel as opt-in
- No migration required; new users auto-get IndexedDB on browsers, logged-in users keep DB

### Deferred to Phase 7
- Opt-in anonymous cohort aggregation
- Fully removing Postgres from production server
- Re-embedding PYQ bundle at 384-dim (currently 3072-dim from Gemini)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-19

### 🧠 GBrain Cognitive Architecture — Major Release

Transforms Project Vidhya from a practice app into a cognitive learning platform. GBrain is a 6-pillar architecture that models how a student thinks, not just what they answer.

### Added — Backend Cognitive Architecture (~2,878 LOC)
- **Pillar 1: Student Model v2** — 15-attribute live profile (mastery vector, speed profile, cognitive style, abstraction comfort, working memory, motivation state, confidence calibration, frustration threshold, exam strategy). Bayesian updates on every attempt.
- **Pillar 2: Error Taxonomy** — 7-type classifier (conceptual/procedural/notation/misread/time-pressure/arithmetic/overconfidence-skip) with Gemini-powered misconception explanations and corrective problem generation.
- **Pillar 3: Concept Graph** — 82 GATE concepts organized as a prerequisite DAG with 112 edges. `traceWeakestPrerequisite()` auto-routes foundation repair.
- **Pillar 4: Adaptive Problem Generator** — Infinite calibrated practice targeting specific (concept × error-type × difficulty) gaps. Self-verified, cached.
- **Pillar 5: Exam Strategy Optimizer** — Personalized playbooks: attempt order, time budgets, confidence-calibrated skip threshold, score maximization planner.
- **Pillar 6: Task Reasoner (Layer 2)** — 5-node decision tree (intent → action → difficulty → format → verification) runs before every chat completion.
- **Migration 011** — 7 new tables, auto-applies on server startup.

### Added — MOAT Operations (~970 LOC)
- `/api/gbrain/audit/:sessionId` — 360° student audit with markdown export

- `/admin/gbrain` — unified admin dashboard (Cohort/Health/Content tabs)
- `/gbrain` — marketing landing page showcasing the architecture

### Added — Infrastructure
- `.github/workflows/gbrain-cron.yml` — 4 scheduled cron jobs (daily-intelligence, seed-rag, verify-sweep, content-gap-fill) with `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs
- `src/api/auth-middleware.ts` — `requireRole('admin', 'teacher')` wraps admin endpoints
- `.claude/bootstrap-skills.sh` — teammate onboarding script for vendored gstack
- 10 MOAT skills in `.claude/skills/` (student-audit, cohort-analysis, content-gap, gbrain-health, daily-intelligence, mock-exam, weekly-digest, misconception-miner, seed-rag, verify-sweep)

### Changed
- `/api/chat` SSE runs Task Reasoner before Gemini; streams `reasoner` event first with `{intent, action, concept, motivation}`
- `ProgressPage` expanded GBrain Intelligence section with 5 MOAT links
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with full MOAT skill catalog and routing rules

### Fixed
- 36 broken skill symlinks in `.claude/skills/` that pointed to a hardcoded macOS path. Vendored gstack; replaced with relative symlinks so teammates on any OS can use skills.

### Security
- Admin endpoints gated via `requireRole('admin', 'teacher')`
- Cron endpoints require `Bearer $CRON_SECRET`

---

## [0.3.0.0] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Navigation restructure:** 5-tab bottom nav → 3 tabs (Home, Notes, Progress) + floating Tutor FAB. The AI tutor is now always one tap away from any page via a sky-blue floating button.
- **Header:** Slimmed from 56px to 48px, removed "GATE Math" text label (kept "G" logo badge). Content padding reduced from `p-4` to `px-4 pt-2 pb-4`.
- **GateHome:** Added quick-help tutor chips below One Thing card ("Explain {topic}" / "Solve a problem step by step"). Fixed dead-end states — "All done" and "Free study day" now link to the tutor. TopicGrid simplified from 2-column cards to horizontal rows.
- **NotebookPage:** Renamed "Smart Notebook" → "Notes". Removed topic completion summary grid and status legend. Simplified collapsed entries to (status dot + query + timestamp).
- **ProgressPage:** Merged weak + all topics into single sorted list (weakest first). Weak topics get amber accent. Shows top 3 by default with "Show all topics" toggle. Removed MasteryRing from topic cards.
- **PracticePage:** Removed verification metadata (tier, duration, confidence). Compact result banner (icon + verdict). "Next Problem" is full-width primary CTA; "All Problems" becomes small text link.
- **ChatPage:** Simplified empty state from 4-card grid to 3 compact chips with colored dots. Shrunk icon from 64px to 48px. Added URL param support (`?prompt=...`) for pre-filling input from home page tutor chips.
- **OnboardPage:** Replaced 10 individual confidence sliders with 3-bucket tappable sort (Weak / Okay / Strong). Faster (10 taps vs 10 drags), more mobile-friendly.
- **DESIGN.md:** Updated nav spec, added FAB spec, rewrote App Declutter Rules, added 4 decisions to log.

## [0.2.2.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Double-tap race condition on rating buttons (ref guard prevents duplicate POSTs)
- Silent error swallowing on rate/skip — now shows transient "Couldn't save" toast
- `profileChecked` not reset on retry — prevents stale profile flash after error recovery
- Defensive guard on `currentTask` access to prevent crash if task index is invalid

## [0.2.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **One Thing Mode:** Home page stripped to a single priority card per session. Tired students at 11pm see one clear instruction instead of a 12-element dashboard
  - Three user states: no profile (onboard CTA), no diagnostic (diagnostic CTA), fully onboarded (One Thing card)
  - Progressive disclosure: complete or skip task #1 to reveal task #2, then #3
  - "Start practicing" navigates directly to a problem via `content_preview.pyq_id` from the daily plan API
  - Celebration state with confetti and MasteryRing when all tasks are done
  - "Free study day!" fallback with topic grid when no tasks are scheduled
- **Tired Student Mode:** AI tutor prompt modifier detects late-night study (after 9pm IST + exam within 30 days) and keeps responses short and actionable
- Streak badge moved to global header (visible on all pages)

### Changed
- Home page WHY line uses encouraging tone ("Biggest room to grow") instead of shaming ("weakest topic")
- All interactive elements now meet 44px minimum touch targets
- Added `prefers-reduced-motion` support, `aria-live` regions, and focus-visible rings throughout home page

## [0.2.1.0] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Blog "See Problems" CTA now takes you to the topic page instead of a broken route. Previously, clicking the CTA on any blog post led nowhere
- Frontend and backend content types are now in sync (was 7 vs 4, only `comparison` overlapped)

### Changed
- All 10 GATE topic definitions live in one place (`src/constants/topics.ts`). Previously scattered across 7 files, which meant adding a topic required 7 edits
- Blog content types centralized into `src/constants/content-types.ts`. Labels, accent colors, and type lists all come from one source now

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Content Intelligence Engine:** Self-improving content loop that gets smarter over time
  - Trend collection from Reddit, Stack Exchange, YouTube, and NewsAPI. Matches external signals to your 10 GATE topics automatically
  - 5-signal priority scoring (user struggle, trend signal, conversion rate, view velocity, coverage gap) decides what content to create next
  - Feedback scoring grades every blog post on engagement, conversion, and relevance. Low performers get auto-archived after 90 days
  - Smart flywheel integration: content-flywheel now picks topics based on priority scores and weaves trend context into Gemini prompts
- **Dark Neubrutalism blog redesign:** Gen Z/Gen Alpha aesthetic with personality
  - Hard 2px borders with content-type accent colors, colored offset shadows (3px 3px) that shift on hover
  - Space Grotesk font (geometric, modern), uppercase bold labels, sharp 4px corners
  - Single-column card feed, topic filter pills, sort tabs (Recent/Trending/Most Read), content type tabs
  - CSS-only stagger entrance animations (80ms per card) + scroll-reveal (progressive enhancement)
  - Full `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility support
  - Sticky floating CTA bar on blog posts bridges readers to the app
  - Zero JS, single font load, ~4KB CSS total
- **App declutter:** Compact hero bar, removed welcome banner, daily challenge threshold raised to 3+ reviews, subtle inline onboarding nudge

### Fixed
- Blog route gracefully falls back when `content_score` column missing (migration not yet applied)

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **Growth Engine:** Full marketing and acquisition stack
  - Blog content pipeline: 4 content types (solved problems, topic explainers, exam strategy, comparison posts) auto-generated from verified problems via Gemini
  - Server-side rendered blog pages, exam landing pages, dynamic sitemap, and RSS feed for SEO
  - Acquisition funnel tracking with backend API (replaces localStorage-only tracking)
  - Retention engine: welcome email sequence, streak reminders, weekly digest via Resend (optional)
  - Push notification subscription and preferences API
  - Social posting: Telegram Bot API + optional Twitter API v2 with IST-aware posting windows
  - Blog admin API: draft/publish/archive workflow with view counting
  - Light theme for public SEO pages, dark theme for app
- **Content Pipeline:** Chat grounding, content previews, prompt modifiers
- **Study Commander:** Priority engine, onboarding diagnostic, personalized daily plans
- **Camera Scan:** OCR problem input with smart notebook and exam readiness scoring
- **AI Tutor:** Streaming chat via SSE with Gemini 2.5-flash
- **3-Tier Verification:** RAG cache, Gemini dual-solve, Wolfram Alpha
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (Google OAuth + email/password), anonymous-first with upgrade
- **Social Autopilot:** Content flywheel generates posts for admin approval
- **Telegram Bot:** Daily problem posting with inline keyboards
- **Frontend:** 10-route React SPA with Duolingo-style UX, bottom nav, progress tracking

### Fixed
- SQL injection in notification preferences endpoint (parameterized queries)
- XSS in SSR blog templates (escape all LLM-generated content, sanitize URLs)
- SPA catch-all exclusion for SSR routes (/blog, /exams, /sitemap.xml, /rss.xml)
- Retention engine reads env vars at call time (testability fix)
