# Alternative body for hypothesis-testing-worked-example, served when the
# learner stance is `shaken`. The base file is what a steady student reads.
# See src/content/stance-variants.ts for how this is selected.
#
# Note: the base atom's own id is `hypothesis-testing-worked-example` (no
# dot before the atom type), a legacy naming drift
# check-content-integrity.ts tolerates. variant_of points at that exact id;
# this file's own id follows the normal convention instead of propagating
# the drift.
#
# Written for a student who is low on this concept and low on confidence:
# smallest true first step, concrete numbers before symbols, picture before
# formula, and the check made explicit. No praise, no reassurance, and no
# mention of how the reader might be feeling — a small win is what steadies
# someone, not being told they are struggling.
#
# The fenced interactive block below is copied verbatim from the base
# atom so the widget cannot drift between variants; only prose differs.

## Identify the test

$\sigma=6$ is known, so use $z$. $H_1:\mu\neq50$ makes it two-tailed.

## Compute

$z=\dfrac{\bar{x}-\mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\dfrac{52-50}{6/\sqrt{36}}=\dfrac{2}{1}=2$.

## Compare to the critical value

Two-tailed, $\alpha=0.05$: critical values $\pm1.96$. Since $|2|>1.96$, the statistic lands in the rejection region.

## Decision

Reject $H_0$. The data are inconsistent with $\mu=50$ at the 5% level.

## Check with the p-value

$p=2\times P(Z>2)=2\times0.0228=0.0456$. Since $0.0456<0.05$, the same conclusion follows — reject. Both routes agree, and agreement is the check.
