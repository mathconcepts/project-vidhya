# Project Vidhya v2.0 — Documentation Index

> **Last updated:** 2026-04-24
> **Total docs:** 26 files + 1 guide + infra/ + `agents/` org chart

This is the master index of all documentation in the `docs/` directory, organised hierarchically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Agent organisation has been restructured.** The product is now
> designed as a one-person company run by 48 agents under a single
> CEO (1 CEO + 6 C-suite + 17 managers + 24 specialists). This
> supersedes the original 7-agent persona architecture described in
> `02-agent-architecture.md`. The authoritative current reference is
> [`../agents/ORG-CHART.md`](../agents/ORG-CHART.md). GBrain is the
> cognitive spine — every cognitively-dependent agent declares its
> GBrain dependency in its YAML manifest, and the validator
> (`python3 agents/validate-graph.py`) enforces it. See
> [`../agents/_shared/gbrain-integration.md`](../agents/_shared/gbrain-integration.md)
> for the contract.

## Notes

- `00-overview.md` was previously the closest to an index — this file supersedes it as master index
- `12-content-delivery.md` and `12-go-live-checklist.md` share the `12-` prefix (renaming deferred)
- `19-deployment-options.md` and `19-audit-report.md` share the `19-` prefix (audit report added 2026-03-10)
- `infra/` contains infrastructure-specific configs (docker-compose, nginx, etc.)
